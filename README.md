LINQ Pocket Reference examples

As the title suggests these are LINQ examples from the LINQ Pocket Reference Book
I started taking courses on Udemy.com and found, with the LINQ courses English was
not the first or second language of the instructor and was very hard to understand.

I have gone to my fall back, books. Reading and practicing with the book seems
like it will be the best way for me to learn the LINQ queries in C#

Wish me luck!
